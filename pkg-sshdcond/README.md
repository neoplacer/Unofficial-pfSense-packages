# SshdCond Unofficial packages for pfSense software

As many people knows, Netgate has trimed a lot of packages from official repo since pfSenseÂ® 2.3. 

This repo updates some packages for newer pfSense software versions with manual procedure installs.

This is not supported by Netgate or pfSense team. Use it at your own risk.

Feedbacks and contributions are always welcome.

The SshdCond package configures ssh extra file for acls and conditions.

# Install instructions

If you enabled the Unofficial repo, you can add this package under System -> Package Manager

Or add it under console/ssh.

cd /root

fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcelloc/Unofficial-pfSense-packages/master/pkg-sshcond/files/install_sshdcond_23.sh

sh ./install_sshdcond_23.sh

Once it finishes, all must be in place. If you do not see the menu after it finishes, try to install any pfSense package from GUI, like cron for example.
