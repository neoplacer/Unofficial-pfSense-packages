# This is an example map file for the sigh milter
#
# The file may contain comments starting at the beginning of a line. Also
# blank lines are allowed. The format of this file is a two column syntax.
# The first column is a key and the second a value. Key and value are devided
# by one or more whitespace characters. It is important to NOT put whitspaces
# in the value column!
#
# The key is simply an email address without angle braces. The value has the
# following form:
#
# <cert> ':' /path/to/cert.pem ',' <key> ':' /path/to/key.pem
#
# <cert> and <key> are keywords. It doesn't matter, if you define the key
# first and the cert second. The certificate file may not only contain the
# pure certificate. You may also concatenate furthe intermediate certificates.
# For both, the certificate and the key, the files must be in PEM format. See
# the OpenSSL documentation how to convert it, if you got them in a different
# format. Furthermore, the key must be in unencrypted. Make sure, you adopt
# the privileges to restrict access only to the milter.
#
# Path names must be absolute and not relative paths!
#
# If you make changes to this file, you must send a SIGHUP signal to the milter
# in order to reload this table.

# Example:
c@roessner.co		cert:/some/path/cert.pem,key:/some/path/key.pem

# Another example
test@example.com    key:/another/path/key.pem,cert:/another/path/cert.pem
